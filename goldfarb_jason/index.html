      <h2>My Proposal</h2>
      <p>For my Capstone I had the unique opportunity to gain real world experience.  I worked on translating react to react-native to make the driver mobile app for the Lazy Buffs website.   Prior to starting on the project I had never been exposed to to either framework. Another very challenging aspect of the project was inheriting code base. Thank you for showing an interest in the g36 cohort.  </p>
